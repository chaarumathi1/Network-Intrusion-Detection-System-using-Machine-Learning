# Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to detect suspicious or malicious activities in network traffic and distinguish them from normal behavior.
## Project Overview
The NIDS developed in this project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze network packet features and identify potential intrusions or anomalies. The system is designed to be efficient, lightweight, and capable of detecting common threats such as SYN floods, port scans, and other network-based attacks.

The detection is done in two ways:

Signature-Based Detection: Identifies known attack patterns using predefined rules.

Anomaly-Based Detection: Detects unusual behavior that deviates from normal patterns using a trained ML model.
## Technologies Used
•	Python

•	Scikit-learn for machine learning

•	NumPy & Pandas for data handling

•	Logging for generating alerts

•	Joblib for saving and loading the ML model

•	Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

•	Matplotlib – For plotting graphs or visualizing detection results.

•	Seaborn  – For enhanced data visualization during exploratory analysis.

•	IPython Display – For better output formatting inside Jupyter Notebook.
## Features
•	 Real-time packet analysis and feature extraction

•	 Signature rule matching for known attacks

•	 Anomaly detection using isolation forest algorithm

•	 Alerts generation and logging for suspicious activity

•	 Modular and customizable for different network environments
